A Python script that uses data from Scryfall to automatically import MtG cards into Kanka.io. (Trademarks belong to their respective owners; see accompanying documentation for more detail.)

@created 2020.05.27
@change 2020.05.27 sts ported from https://repl.it/@ElectricalAptit/kankfall#main.py so as to test Kanka interactions without making the API key quite so public.
@change 2020.05.27 sts fixed git nonsense; set to UTF-8; adjustments to pull from constants.py
